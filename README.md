# MumboOBS
OBS Recording / Streaming Indicator - [Download Under Releases](https://github.com/rcmaehl/MumboOBS/releases)

Inspired by a live stream from MumboJumbo in which Xisuma and Mumbo both complained about accidentally recording with OBS and screwing up videos because of it. This app accurately displays the state of recording / streaming using Scroll Lock while still allowing you to use whatever keybind you like.
